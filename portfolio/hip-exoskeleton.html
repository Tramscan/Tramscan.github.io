            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>My work on the hip exoskeleton was twofold; I researched the reaction to an applied load using the exoskeleton and developed controllers and tools to enable more powerful exoskeleton uses.</p>
            <h2>Technical Details</h2>
            <p>At the UMass Human Robot Systems Lab (HRSL) I worked as a graduate researcher while completing my M.S. to research and develop new methods for controlling gait. Patients with traumatic injuries or neurological conditions will often have asymmetric neuromotor impairments which may affect their ability to perform daily functions, including walking. A common goal of exoskeleton research is to identify methods to rehabilitate these impairments by interacting with the patient in some way. The HRSL Hip Exoskeleton was created to apply resistive or assistive loads on the hip during experiments and hopefully identify gait reactions to those loads. Equipped with one Dephy ActPack on each side, the Hip Exoskeleton is capable of asymmetric loading on the hip joint and independently record metrics from each side using the onboard sensors. </p>
            <p>Early in my time with the HRSL, we ran a study to evaluate the impact of asymettric stiffness across the hip joint using the exoskeleton. (insert more about the study, the results, what led to the custom controllers' need)</p>
            <h2>Custom Controllers and Experimental Tools</h2>
            <p>During the study, we had primarily used the proprietary software from Dephy for motor actuation and data recording. However, the API and custom scripting was a more powerful option for creating controllers and tools for data processing. (insert more about my controllers, quality of life, optimization, future work)</p>
            <h2>Interests within neuromotor control and robotics</h2>
            <p>The lab opened up my view on research and really opened up a love for research in this field. (more)</p>
            <h2>Results and Impact</h2>
            <p>Discussion of the project's outcomes, any testing results, and the potential impact on users and the field of assistive technology.  (maybe add about what this gave me skill-wise and the overall achievement of being at the lab)</p>
